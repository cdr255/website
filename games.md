## Games I am Working On

I am a bit of a game designer, and these are my projects.

### Tabletop Games

#### True20 Supplements

I\'m currently about to launch a new ttrpg campaign using the
[True20][1] system, and figured I would post the WIP-style SRDs I\'m
developing because of that here as they are finished.

* [Backgrounds](falode-bgs.html)
* [Codes of Honor](falode-cod.html)
* [The Falodian Pantheon](falode-god.html)
* [Map of Beebrook Region][2]

#### Original Games

* **DERPS** - the Dynamically Equivalent Role Playing System.
* **The Duchies** - Build up Your city better than anyone elses.
* **Elemental Warfare** - A game about gaining and holding on to
  territory.
* **Three Way** - A point collecting game based around choosing Your own
  path.

### Video Games

* **Nubivagant** - To fly or not to fly? A Visual Novel.
