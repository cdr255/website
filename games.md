## Games I am Working On

I am a bit of a game designer, and these are my projects.

### Tabletop Games

#### True20 Supplements

I once ran a 100% homebrew ttrpg campaign using the [True20][1]
system, and figured I would post the WIP-style SRDs I used here.

* [Backgrounds](falode-bgs.html)
* [Codes of Honor](falode-cod.html)
* [The Falodian Pantheon](falode-god.html)
* [Map of Beebrook Region][2]

#### Original Games

* **Elemental Warfare** - A game about gaining and holding on to
  territory.

### Video Games

* **Nubivagant** - To fly or not to fly? A Visual Novel.
