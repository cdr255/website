## Collections

On my old site, I had a section for each of my major instruments which
collected all of the pieces I had played along with relevant information
about each.. I also had, on my computer, a table for each video game
system I owned which listed the games I had amassed... and I was
beginning to tabulate other collections of things I was amassing, such
as board games and wargame armies.

After stalling for two weeks trying to format these collections
uniformly and properly for this new site, I have decided instead to make
that the duty of my blog, [Toft and Toddy][1]. This page will link to
the most recent versions of each of my collections, as they are written.
