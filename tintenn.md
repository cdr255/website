## Project Tintenn

From October 28, 2015 to April 5th, 2016 I posted (on a semi-regular
basis) serial micro-fiction on Twitter under the [#tintenn][1]
hashtag. I then took a hiatus for various reasons.

On July 21, 2017, someone began using that hashtag to promote
themselves on Twitter. Since this had been on hiatus for over a year
by then, I decided to permanently shelve it, at least under this name.

Perhaps one day I will try this again. It was fun, but very
stressful. Making things flow both as a long-form story and from day
to day is a difficult balance.

Anyway, I've embedded all of the tweets here for ease of reading.
