## My Conlangs

I do a bit of [Conlanging][1] in my spare time, especially for my games
and stories. Here\'s what I have done to the point where I can share it.

### Valleyscript

[Truetype Font][3]

Used to write and read the common tongue in the world of **Esoterica**,
though as of right now it has the glyphs necessary to read and write
English.

**Truetype Font** *(Coming Soon!)*

The first fully usable script I ever created. It was originally for use
in a [DND][5] campaign I was running at the time, but I am currently
thinking of using it in another project I have ongoing.

### Wirescript

**Truetype Font** *(Coming Later!)*

This script came from an idea where a culture has no access to inks or
dyes, but bountiful access to metals and precious stones... to the point
where they are used for writing, and not worth very much. The script\'s
lower part is meant to be some kind of metal wire set into another
medium, and the upper part is meant to be differently cut precious
stones, depending on the vowel in question.
