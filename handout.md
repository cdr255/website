  This is an HTML version of the first player handout for the Lacis
  Lycorma Campaign. It contains no campaign spoilers, but it does
  introduce a few interesting pieces of information to help flesh out
  the world around the players at the start of the campaign.

### Meta Info

  This adventure (and, as this is the first part, this campaign) was
  designed for a party of 5 Level 1 Mostly-Non-Evil PCs. It uses
  Golarion as a base, specifically the Inner Sea Region, and is meant
  to go on for a long time.
  
## Setting

  This section details the background information of the areas
  expected to show up in the first session.

### The Nation of Andoran
  
  The adventure begins in the port city of Augustana, in the Arthfell
  region, on the North side of the Aspo Bay. It is the second largest
  city in Andoran, the "Birthplace of Freedom".

#### Politics
  
  Here, the Common Rule holds sway beneath the leadership of Supreme
  Elect Codwin I, who is in his third term leading the People's
  Council.

  During his long rule, he's done many things to reinforce Andoren
  views against slavery, reverence of the Common Rule, and desire to
  remain a united nation instead of many smaller states. However, due
  to his many years in office, some people are beginning to grumble
  that his rule is beginning to take on the appearance and stink of
  monarchy, and thus are starting to float the idea of term limits.

  Common Rule was established nearly fifty years ago, following
  Andoran's secession from it's western neighbor, the empire of
  Cheliax.  It's based on the concept that all are inherently equal in
  importance, and that no individual has the right to force their own
  beliefs upon another. This libertarian ideal guides much of Andoren
  politics, even to this day.

  The People's Council is the elected body meant to govern
  Andoran. Its 350 members are elected from the trade guilds and
  municipalities of Andoran every five years, after which they elect
  one of their own to becom the Supreme Elect. They meet in the
  capital city, Almas, every six months (with special sessions as
  needed) to appoint magistrates, draft laws, and fill newly-vacant
  regional positions in Andoran.

#### Geography

  Andoran is located on the northern coast of the Inner Sea. The
  nation is separated from its western neighbor, the empire of
  Cheliax, by the Aspodell Mountains.

  The Five Kings Range perform a similar function in the north,
  serving as a barrier between Andoran and the nations of Druma,
  Isger, Kyonin, and the Five Kings Mountains.

  To the east lie the nations of Galt and Taldor; much of Andoran's
  eastern border lies within the Verduran Forest, and follows the flow
  of the Sellen River.

  To the south is the Aspo Bay, which surrounds the City at the Center
  of the world, Absalom. On the other side of the Bay are the ancient
  desert nations of Osirion and Thuvia.
  
  The nation can be divided into five general regions: the capital
  city of Almas and its surrounding countryside, the coastal Arthfell
  region, the agriculture-rich Carpenden Plains, Darkmoon Vale,
  dominated by the Lumber Consortium, and the fey-contested Verduran
  Forest.

  Andoran's interior is dominated by plains and hills, and the
  remnants of Arthfell Forest. Darkmoon Vale in the northwest is
  dominated by Droskar's Crag, a massive volcano that serves as the
  southernmost point of the Five Kings Range.

#### People

  The human population of Andoran is primarily of Chelaxian and Taldan
  extraction, with halflings the most common non-human race. Andoran
  also has the largest concentration of kobolds in the Inner Sea
  region, and one of the biggest number of aasimars.
  
  Above all else, the citizens of Andoran are passionate about their
  country and their freedom. A history of being ruled by foreign
  powers, first under Taldor, and then Cheliax, resulted in a heavy
  burden; over time, as the region's resources and the people's
  independence were slowly worn away, this burden grew too great to be
  tolerated any longer.

  This history, however, has made the most common non-Common tongues
  in the region Taldane and (much less common, but still) Infernal.

  The proud people of Andoran claimed their nation's sovereignty, and
  are determined to prove to disbelievers that the concepts of freedom
  and equality that they hold will remain strong in the face of any
  hardship.

  The people that inhabit the nation of Andoran are also highly
  opinionated, often holding differing perspectives on how best to
  preserve their nation and spread its influence. That said, almost
  all Andorens share certain beliefs in common:

1. Arguments and discussions should be based on merit, rather than
  half-truths or falsehoods.
2. All people have a right to have their voice heard, and one should be
  judged by their actions above all else.
3. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, so long as it is not actually
  that of a foreign power.
  
  By embracing and preserving these beliefs and others like them, the
  people of Andoran hope to ensure Common Rule, and the freedom it
  brings, for many generations to come.

## Rule Clarifications

  This section defines the game rules we're using in the game.

### Character Creation Rules

#### Point Buy
  
  We're using a 20-point point buy for creating characters. The costs
  are based on the following table: 

   | Score | Cost |
   |:-----:|:----:|
   | 07    | −04  |
   | 08    | −02  |
   | 09    | −01  |
   | 10    | ±00  |
   | 11    | +01  |
   | 12    | +02  |
   | 13    | +03  |
   | 14    | +05  |
   | 15    | +07  |
   | 16    | +10  |
   | 17    | +13  |
   | 18    | +17  |
{: caption="Point Buy Costs"}

  You need to set each of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
  Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma to one of those scores, and the
  total cost should be equal to 20. This should be done *before*
  Your race modifiers are applied: If You are using the sheet I
  recommended, the score You choose should go in the "Base" column
  of Your attributes.

  This is also called a "High Fantasy" point buy, if You are using a
  calculator online. If so, just ignore the race selector or set it to
  human and don't add anything to any of Your chosen scores. You'll do
  that manually, after the point buy is over.

#### Hero Points

  There's an optional rule system we're going to use called "Hero
  Points". These little credits help encourage drama and roleplay at
  the table. Things You can do with them include, but are not limited
  to:

* Act out of turn in combat.
* Reroll any 1d20 roll, taking the second result (even if it's worse).
* Gain a luck bonus to a 1d20 roll.
* Gain Inspiration on what to do next (GM hint).
* Move or Act twice in one turn.
* Cheat Death, if You have two of them.

Every character starts play with 1 Hero Point. You also gain hero
points automatically when You level up, or (if You had none when You
died) when You are raised from the dead. The final way to get them
is through my granting them to You. There are no rules saying when I
can do so; It's up to my discretion, but a few of the things I will
grant hero points for are:

* Writing out a backstory for Your character, or completing a
  character detail sheet.
* Completing major arcs in the story.
* Succeessfully doing something very difficult in game.
* Roleplaying with Your fellow players well.
* Appeasing Your chosen God/Liege/Doctrine/etc.
* Acting like a hero.

	I'll also give You one if You go a whole session, start to finish,
with none at all. Remember, I can and will award these as I please,
and they are something I use to encourage *dramatic storytelling*
and *roleplay*. I'm pretty liberal with them, compared to other GMs
I've played with, so don't horde them too much.

#### Errata

  A lot of people don't really like to keep track of things like food
  and spell components. I'm fine with not forcing You to spend 1 cp
  each on 20 different spell components; instead, I'll let You choose
  how much You've spent on "Spell Components" in general, and every
  time You would have needed one we'll subtract the cost from that
  pool. It makes it simple to track while not removing a check on
  unlimited arcane power in the system.

  As for food, provided You return to a city once every 24 hours or so
  and buy Your kit at the beginning of the game, I'll assume You've
  eaten. That makes it so You are carrying rations weight-wise and not
  going weeks without eating, but also prevents You from having to
  remember to buy food for 3 meals a day.

  That said, I \emph{do} have my players track carrying
  capacities. And that's including any treasure You might find, and
  money (50 coins = 1 lb, regardless of denomination (CRB, p140). I'd
  recommend getting a sack, too, though I don't really bother with
  inventory management other than weight.

  Sleep, also, exists in my game:

> Characters who do not get a full night’s sleep may suffer the
> effects of fatigue. If a PC does not get at least 6 hours of sleep,
> she must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be fatigued and take a –1
> penalty on all other checks and saving throws against sleep
> effects. A second night without sleep requires another DC 15
> Fortitude save. A failed save results in the character becoming
> exhausted and the penalties increasing to –2. A third failed save on
> the next night increases the penalties to –3.

  Sleeping in armor (unless You specifically have a character trait
  that overrides this) just makes You fatigued each night You do
  so. Though, if You are already fatigued and pull an all nighter, You
  will be exhausted.

## Character Creation Outline

  Character Creation basically goes like this:

### Character Creation Cheat Sheet
  
1. Buy **Attributes**.
2. Pick a **Class** and a **Race**.
3. Choose **Skills**.
4. Choose **Feats**.
5. Choose **Gear**.
6. Fill In Blanks on Sheet
7. Detail Character

### Detailed Character Creation

  What follows is a more detailed description of the process, but feel
  free to use the above instead. This is mostly to clarify some of the
  more confusing parts.

#### Character Concept
  
  The first thing You need to do, though, is have a **character
  concept**. It's important to have an idea of the kind of character You
  might like to play, because it helps to guide Your decisions going
  forward with the character creation. It can be as simple as 'A
  warrior', or as complex as 'A disgraced noble who wants to clear his
  name by doing good deeds'. It shouldn't be more than one or two
  sentences though, because that'll come during character creation.

  This is doubly important because, in the end, this is a Role-Playing
  Game. I value roleplaying pretty highly in the games I run; If You don't
  have a role You want to play (other than a race/class/spec combo
  like in an MMO), You won't have as much fun as You could at my
  table.

#### Attributes

  Next, is Your **attributes**. I usually have my players do a 20
  point point-buy, which You can do without a problem using a
  calculator online. And there are many good articles on maximizing
  Your character's bonuses using a 20 point buy.

  A good strategy, if You are torn by indecision in this point, is to
  list the **Attributes** in order of importance to Your character. A
  really tough character would value **CON** over **DEX**, for
  example. Once You have them all in order, simply assign Your
  attributes in this order: **15, 14, 14, 14, 12, 7**.

  This is an optimized generalist array of scores for the 20
  point-buy. This works with any array You find online, though (feel
  free to use others).

#### Class/Race Combo 
  
  Once You have Your **Attributes** selected, You pick a **race** and a
  **class**. Unlike some older games, there are no restrictions as to
  which **race** can pick which **class**. You can pick any combination.

  Generally, I suggest people pick a **class** first if they are stuck,
  because otherwise You end up with a lot of Elven Wizards, Halfling
  Rogues, Dwarven Clerics, Human Fighters, Gnomish Illusionists/Bards,
  Half-Elven Rangers/Druids, and Half-Orc Barbarians. There's nothing
  wrong with any of those, but there's no reason a Dwarf *has* to be a
  Cleric. Picking the **class** first helps people avoid those sterotypes
  influencing their decisions.

  As for where to choose Your **class** from, they get more complex
  as You go down this line: Unchained Class → Core Class → Base Class
  → Hybrid Class → Prestige Class. If You want to keep things simple,
  start with a **Core class** and go from there.

  And, just so I mention them, there are a *lot* of **Archetypes** for
  most classes. These allow You to tweak a **class** to more
  closely fit Your **character concept**, and can be great! But, they
  can also slow You down a whole lot in terms of character creation,
  and can also lead to regrets down the line. Approach with cautious
  excitement.

#### Skills

  Once You have those picked, It's time for **Skills**. This can be
  a little tricky for newcomers, just because it looks overly
  complex.

  **To keep things simple:** Spend one **skill point** on each of Your
  **class skills** until You run out. Spend the rest as You
  wish. Read on for details.

  At level 1, You get a certain number of **skill points** plus
  Your **Int** Bonus, for example 4 + 2. That would mean You have 6
  ranks to spend. You also have a few skills which Your class is
  generally good at. These are Your **class skills**, and they get a +3
  bonus if You have spent at least one rank in them.

  You can only spend as many ranks on a skill as You have levels, so
  the most You can spend on a skill right now is 1. A simple way to
  quickly spend them is to buy as many of Your class skills as You
  can. If You don't just wanna do that, universally good skills to
  spend on are **Perception, Sense Motive**, and **Stealth**.

#### Feats
  
  Next is **Feats**, which are simple enough. You get one at first
  level, an extra one if You took a Fighter-based **class**, and an
  extra one if You are human.

  Feats are little traits that make Your character better at
  something. Picking Feats is a hotly debated topic, so I can't give
  any broad recommendations, but when all else fails "Toughness" is
  never a bad choice.

  There are many guides by various people online for each class. YMMV.

#### Equipment

  Second to last is Your **Equipment**. There are "Kits" for most
  classes, or that will work well with similar classes. I suggest
  buying those, a weapon, some armor, and then looking at what You
  have left to spend.

  Remember to divy up any remaining money! We store money as coins
  (see the **Rules** section for details).

  By this point, a lot of people are kind of bored and basically done
  with making characters. If that's You, don't worry. You are
  basically done, and just buying the above is fine to start out with.
  
#### Fill In Details
  
  Finally, looking at Your sheet, fill in any and all blanks. No
  bonus?  Write a Zero. Not able to be used? Type an —. This helps
  when You are looking at Your sheet and Wondering what Your Swim
  Skill is, only to find that You didn't fill it out because You spent
  no ranks on it, and now Your character is drowning and everything
  sucks.

  This is also when any details You skipped at the beginning get
  filled in: What they look like, Where they're from, Who they
  worship, etc.

  And there You go, all done! Easy as 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10... I
  know. But, it gets easier the more You do it. And You are all done
  now! Congrats!
