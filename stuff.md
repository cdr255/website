## Other Stuff

This page collects all items I work on that have no better, proper place
yet. If enough of a certain item amass here, I will move them to their
own section.

### Character Sheets

Character sheets are compact, organized ways to store all of the
information about a specific character in the context of a [TTRPG][1].
These here are custom sheets I have made for one reason or another, that
are **not** for my own games.

* [Capes RPG][2] Unofficial Character Sheet v1.0 - [Download][3]

### Forms

These are all [elisp][4] files for use in [GNU/Emacs][5] (in
[forms-mode][6]) that I use for one reason or another. They are usable
on any OS, because [GNU/Emacs][5] works on any OS... And are the most
efficient, compact way to store information. [Here][7] is a blog post I
wrote about why I like to use them instead of [.doc][8] files or
[pdfs][9].
