# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog][001], though this project
does not really adhere to [Semantic Versioning][002] because it's
really just a poster used to collect static content and doesn't have a
concievable "API" at all aside from TCP itself.
