## Programs and Scripts I\'ve Written

#### Humour Deck Program

This little program manipulates a deck of cards I\'ve been working on
creating (details will be linked here once I get a set of rules
together). It\'s in alpha, but it *does* build and has all of the cards
available. Source code is hosted on [Github][1].
