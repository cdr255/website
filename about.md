## About Me

My name is Christopher Rodriguez.

### Music

I am a musician from the South Jersey Area, currently living in the
Cherry Hill Area (with plans to move to PA soon). I play the [lever
harp][1], the [electric bass][2], the [5 string banjo][3], and the
[anglo concertina][4] alongside a lot of other instruments.

I\'ve been playing music for 12 years now, ever since I picked up my
mom\'s old 6 string in Sophmore year of High School. I [give
lessons](/lessons/) for the guitar and banjo, as well as
[record](/recordings/) and [compose](/compositions/).

I also make music using [LSDJ][5].

### Technology

I am a big supporter of [GNU/Linux][6]. I do all of my work on \*NIX
based computers, and maintain computers for others with [Windows][7] and
[OS/X][8] installed.

I do [data recovery](/support/) along with [system repair](/support/) 
as freelance work. I have built and run many websites over the years,
and maintain this website myself. I am familiar with many different
languages and paradigms, but I am most used to [C++][9], [lua][10],
[ruby][11], and [e-LISP][12].

I am on [github][13], too!

### Writing

I have an inactive [serial blog][14] called [Prose and Prosody][15],
and often participate in projects like [NaNoWriMo][16]. Some of my
past projects *not* hosted on [Prose and Prosody][15] include
[Affuage][17] and [Project Pygmalion][18].

I try to make as much of a habit out of writing as I can. I also have a
blog, [Toft and Toddy][19], where I write about whatever is on my mind
at the moment.

### Games

I play a lot of games, and I am something of an aspiring game
designer, as well.

I\'ve run some [tabletop role-playing games](/logs/), and I like
to [review](/reviews/) both video and board games as well. I am
on [steam][20].

I have a few [original games](/games/) in the works. I am on
[boardgamegeek][21].
