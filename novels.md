### [Affuage][2]

A story about six individuals in a high-magic, high-fantasy world,
brought together by chance on two sides of the same board. As they both
try to enact their will upon the world around them, their choices define
exactly where that world is going, what it is doing, and how the future
will unfold.

### [Project Pygmalion][3]

Two lovers, Karia and Mali, get engaged one evening after a long night
in the clubs of Cell 5. When they come across Mali\'s perfect dress and
cannot afford it, they become wrapped up in a cycle which has been
repeating for years. Can they break the cycle, or will their love become
just another memory echoing through the ether of time?
