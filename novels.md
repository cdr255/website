### First Draft WIP

#### Affuage [Online][2]{:style="display: block; text-align: left;"}

A story about six individuals in a high-magic, high-fantasy world,
brought together by chance on two sides of the same board. As they both
try to enact their will upon the world around them, their choices define
exactly where that world is going, what it is doing, and how the future
will unfold.

#### Incandescent Shock **Offline**{:style="display: block; text-align: left;"}

Colonies need protection, and it is no different on the planet of
Istra. Petya, Anjali, and Dom are young recruits to the defense
force. As they learn to grow beyond friends and into allies, they
uncover something that could change the lives of every single person
they've ever known. What they decide to do about it will test their
bond, their wills, and who they are themselves.

#### Project Pygmalion [Online][3]{:style="display: block; text-align: left;"}

Two lovers, Karia and Mali, get engaged one evening after a long night
in the clubs of Cell 5. When they come across Mali\'s perfect dress and
cannot afford it, they become wrapped up in a cycle which has been
repeating for years. Can they break the cycle, or will their love become
just another memory echoing through the ether of time?
