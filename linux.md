## GNU/Linux

I do all of my work, from music composition, to game development, to
creating this website, on [GNU/Linux][1].

If You\'d like to give it a try, I recommend [this website\'s quiz][2]
as a way to pick a distribution to try. Or, You can do what I did: Jump
in the deep end with [Slackware Linux][3].

Thanks for this operating system are due to two people, and their
respective groups:

* [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)][4] and the [Free Software Foundation][5]
  for founding and developing all of the free software tools that this
  system is built on.

* [Linus Torvalds][6] and the [Linux Foundation][7], which created the
  kernel and advocate for its use worldwide.
